This project implements utilities for validating base-number strings, converting between decimal and bases 2-16, comparing base-number strings, and finding the index of the maximum value in a string array. The **isNumber** method ensures the validity of input strings by checking the format and confirming that digits align with the specified base. **number2Int** converts valid base-number strings to decimal integers, while **int2Number** performs the reverse, building a base-number string from a decimal integer. The **equals** method determines whether two base-number strings are equivalent by converting both to decimal and comparing values. Finally, **maxIndex** iterates through an array of base-number strings, converts each to decimal, and returns the index of the largest value. Unit tests verify all methods' functionality, covering both valid and invalid inputs and logical correctness.
